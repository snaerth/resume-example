For example, boxShadow has values like \"10px 10px 20px 30px rgb(255,0,0)\" which would utterly confuse other plugins. This method allows us to split that data apart and grab only the numeric data and attach it to uniquely-named properties of a generic proxy object ({}) so that we can feed that to virtually any plugin to have the numbers tweened. However, we must also keep track of which properties from the proxy go with which CSSPropTween values and instances. So we create a linked list of MiniPropTweens. Each one records a target (the original CSSPropTween), property (like \"s\" or \"xn1\" or \"xn2\") that we're tweening and the unique property name that was used for the proxy (like \"boxShadow_xn1\" and \"boxShadow_xn2\") and whether or not they need to be rounded. That way, in the _setPluginRatio() method we can simply copy the values over from the proxy to the CSSPropTween instance(s). Then, when the main CSSPlugin setRatio() method runs and applies the CSSPropTween values accordingly, they're updated nicely. So the external plugin tweens the numbers, _setPluginRatio() copies them over, and setRatio() acts normally, applying css-specific values to the element.\n\t\t\t\t * This method returns an object that has the following properties:\n\t\t\t\t *  - proxy: a generic object containing the starting values for all the properties that will be tweened by the external plugin.

These instances store important information like the target, property, starting value, amount of change, etc. They can also optionally have a number of \"extra\" strings and numeric values named xs1, xn1, xs2, xn2, xs3, xn3, etc. where \"s\" indicates string and \"n\" indicates number. These can be pieced together in a complex-value tween (type:1) that has alternating types of data like a string, number, string, number, etc. For example, boxShadow could be \"5px 5px 8px rgb(102, 102, 51)\". In that value, there are 6 numbers that may need to tween and then pieced back together into a string again with spaces, suffixes, etc. xs0 is special in that it stores the suffix for standard (type:0) tweens, -OR- the first string (prefix) in a complex-value (type:1) CSSPropTween -OR- it can be the non-tweening value in a type:-1 CSSPropTween. We do this to conserve memory.\n\t\t\t\t * CSSPropTweens have the following optional properties as well (not defined through the constructor):\n\t\t\t\t *  - l: Length in terms of the number of extra properties that the CSSPropTween has (default: 0). For example, for a boxShadow we may need to tween 5 numbers in which case l would be 5; Keep in mind that the start/end values for the first number that's tweened are always stored in the s and c properties to conserve memory. All additional values thereafter are stored in xn1, xn2, etc.\n\t\t\t\t *  - xfirst: The first instance of any sub-CSSPropTweens that are tweening properties of this instance. For example, we may split up a boxShadow tween so that there's a main CSSPropTween of type:1 that has various xs* and xn* values associated with the h-shadow, v-shadow, blur, color, etc. Then we spawn a CSSPropTween for each of those that has a higher priority and runs BEFORE the main CSSPropTween so that the values are all set by the time it needs to re-assemble them. The xfirst gives us an easy way to identify the first one in that chain which typically ends at the main one (because they're all prepende to the linked list)\n\t\t\t\t *  - plugin: The TweenPlugin instance that will handle the tweening of any complex values. For example, sometimes we don't want to use normal subtweens (like xfirst refers to) to tween the values - we might want ThrowPropsPlugin or BezierPlugin some other plugin to do the actual tweening, so we create a plugin instance and store a reference here. We need this reference so that if we get a request to round values or disable a tween, we can pass along that request.\n\t\t\t\t *  - data: Arbitrary data that needs to be stored with the CSSPropTween. Typically if we're going to have a plugin handle the tweening of a complex-value tween, we create a generic object that stores the END values that we're tweening to and the CSSPropTween's xs1, xs2, etc. have the starting values. We store that object as data. That way, we can simply pass that object to the plugin and use the CSSPropTween as the target.\n\t\t\t\t *  - setRatio: Only used for type:2 tweens that require custom functionality. In this case, we call the CSSPropTween's setRatio() method and pass the ratio each time the tween updates. This isn't quite as efficient as doing things directly in the CSSPlugin's setRatio() method, but it's very convenient and flexible.\n\t\t\t\t * @param {!Object} t Target object whose property will be tweened. Often a DOM element, but not always. It could be anything.\n\t\t\t\t * @param {string} p Property to tween (name). For example, to tween element.width, p would be \"width\".\n\t\t\t\t * @param {number} s Starting numeric value\n\t\t\t\t * @param {number} c Change in numeric value over the course of the entire tween. For example, if element.width starts at 5 and should end at 100, c would be 95.\n\t\t\t\t * @param {CSSPropTween=} next The next CSSPropTween in the linked list. If one is defined, we will define its _prev as the new instance, and the new instance's _next will be pointed at it.\n\t\t\t\t * @param {number=} type The type of CSSPropTween where -1 = a non-tweening value, 0 = a standard simple tween, 1 = a complex value (like one that has multiple numbers in a comma- or space-delimited string like border:\"1px solid red\"), and 2 = one that uses a custom setRatio function that does all of the work of applying the values on each update.\n\t\t\t\t * @param {string=} n Name of the property that should be used for overwriting purposes which is typically the same as p but not always. For example, we may need to create a subtween for the 2nd part of a \"clip:rect(...)\" tween in which case \"p\" might be xs1 but \"n\" is still \"clip\"\n\t\t\t\t * @param {boolean=} r If true, the value(s) should be rounded\n\t\t\t\t * @param {number=} pr Priority in the linked list order.

The reason this functionality is\n\t\t\t * wrapped into a separate static method of CSSPlugin instead of being integrated into all regular className tweens\n\t\t\t * is because it creates entirely new tweens that may have completely different targets than the original tween,\n\t\t\t * so if they were all lumped into the original tween instance, it would be inconsistent with the rest of the API\n\t\t\t * and it would create other problems. For example:\n\t\t\t *  - If I create a tween of elementA, that tween instance may suddenly change its target to include 50 other elements (unintuitive if I specifically defined the target I wanted)\n\t\t\t *  - We can't just create new independent tweens because otherwise, what happens if the original/parent tween is reversed or pause or dropped into a TimelineLite for tight control? You'd expect that tween's behavior to affect all the others.\n\t\t\t *  - Analyzing every style property of every child before and after the tween is an expensive operation when there are many children, so this behavior shouldn't be imposed on all className tweens by default, especially since it's probably rare that this extra functionality is needed.\n\t\t\t *\n\t\t\t * @param {Object} target object to be tweened\n\t\t\t * @param {number} Duration in seconds (or frames for frames-based tweens)\n\t\t\t * @param {Object} Object containing the end values, like {className:\"newClass\", ease:Linear.easeNone}\n\t\t\t * @return {Array} An array of TweenLite instances\n\t\t\t */\n\t\t\tCSSPlugin.cascadeTo = function(target, duration, vars) {\n\t\t\t\tvar tween = TweenLite.to(target, duration, vars),\n\t\t\t\t\tresults = [tween],\n\t\t\t\t\tb = [],\n\t\t\t\t\te = [],\n\t\t\t\t\ttargets = [],\n\t\t\t\t\t_reservedProps = TweenLite._internals.reservedProps,\n\t\t\t\t\ti, difs, p, from;\n\t\t\t\ttarget = tween._targets || tween.target;\n\t\t\t\t_getChildStyles(target, b, targets);\n\t\t\t\ttween.render(duration, true, true);\n\t\t\t\t_getChildStyles(target, e);\n\t\t\t\ttween.render(0, true, true);\n\t\t\t\ttween._enabled(true);\n\t\t\t\ti = targets.length;\n\t\t\t\twhile (--i > -1) {\n\t\t\t\t\tdifs = _cssDif(targets[i], b[i], e[i]);\n\t\t\t\t\tif (difs.firstMPT) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdifs = difs.difs;\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor (p in vars) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tif (_reservedProps[p]) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdifs[p] = vars[p];\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom = {};\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor (p in difs) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom[p] = b[i][p];\n\t\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t\t\tresults.push(TweenLite.fromTo(targets[i], duration, from, difs));\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\treturn results;\n\t\t\t};\n\t\n\t\t\tTweenPlugin.activate([CSSPlugin]);\n\t\t\treturn CSSPlugin;\n\t\n\t\t}, true);\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t/*\n\t * ----------------------------------------------------------------\n\t * RoundPropsPlugin\n\t * ----------------------------------------------------------------\n\t */\n\t\t(function() {\n\t\n\t\t\tvar RoundPropsPlugin = _gsScope._gsDefine.plugin({\n\t\t\t\t\tpropName: \"roundProps\",\n\t\t\t\t\tversion: \"1.6.0\",\n\t\t\t\t\tpriority: -1,\n\t\t\t\t\tAPI: 2,\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t//called when the tween renders for the first time.

We set the _rawPrevTime to be a precise tiny number to indicate this scenario rather than using another property/variable which would increase memory usage. This technique is less readable, but more efficient.\n\t\t\t\t\tif (time === 0 && isComplete) { //if there's a zero-duration tween at the very beginning of a timeline and the playhead lands EXACTLY at time 0, that tween will correctly render its end values, but we need to keep the timeline alive for one more render so that the beginning values render properly as the parent's playhead keeps moving beyond the begining. Imagine obj.x starts at 0 and then we do tl.set(obj, {x:100}).to(obj, 1, {x:200}) and then later we tl.reverse()...the goal is to have obj.x revert to 0. If the playhead happens to land on exactly 0, without this chunk of code, it'd complete the timeline and remove it from the rendering queue (not good).\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttween = this._first;\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhile (tween && tween._startTime === 0) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tif (!tween._duration) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tisComplete = false;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttween = tween._next;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t\ttime = 0; //to avoid occasional floating point rounding errors (could cause problems especially with zero-duration tweens at the very beginning of the timeline)\n\t\t\t\t\tif (!this._initted) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinternalForce = true;\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t}\n\n\t\t\t} else {\n\n\t\t\t\tif (this._hasPause && !this._forcingPlayhead && !suppressEvents) {\n\t\t\t\t\tif (time >= prevTime) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttween = this._first;\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhile (tween && tween._startTime <= time && !pauseTween) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tif (!tween._duration) if (tween.data === \"isPause\" && !tween.ratio && !(tween._startTime === 0 && this._rawPrevTime === 0)) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpauseTween = tween;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttween = tween._next;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t\t} else {\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttween = this._last;\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhile (tween && tween._startTime >= time && !pauseTween) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tif (!tween._duration) if (tween.data === \"isPause\" && tween._rawPrevTime > 0) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpauseTween = tween;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttween = tween._prev;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t\tif (pauseTween) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthis._time = time = pauseTween._startTime;\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthis._totalTime = time + (this._cycle * (this._totalDuration + this._repeatDelay));\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t}\n\n\t\t\t\tthis._totalTime = this._time = this._rawPrevTime = time;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\tif ((this._time === prevTime || !this._first) && !force && !internalForce && !pauseTween) {\n\t\t\t\treturn;\n\t\t\t} else if (!this._initted) {\n\t\t\t\tthis._initted = true;\n\t\t\t}\n\n\t\t\tif (!this._active) if (!this._paused && this._time !== prevTime && time > 0) {\n\t\t\t\tthis._active = true;  //so that if the user renders the timeline (as opposed to the parent timeline rendering it), it is forced to re-render and align it with the proper time/frame on the next rendering cycle.

For example, boxShadow has values like \"10px 10px 20px 30px rgb(255,0,0)\" which would utterly confuse other plugins. This method allows us to split that data apart and grab only the numeric data and attach it to uniquely-named properties of a generic proxy object ({}) so that we can feed that to virtually any plugin to have the numbers tweened. However, we must also keep track of which properties from the proxy go with which CSSPropTween values and instances. So we create a linked list of MiniPropTweens. Each one records a target (the original CSSPropTween), property (like \"s\" or \"xn1\" or \"xn2\") that we're tweening and the unique property name that was used for the proxy (like \"boxShadow_xn1\" and \"boxShadow_xn2\") and whether or not they need to be rounded. That way, in the _setPluginRatio() method we can simply copy the values over from the proxy to the CSSPropTween instance(s). Then, when the main CSSPlugin setRatio() method runs and applies the CSSPropTween values accordingly, they're updated nicely. So the external plugin tweens the numbers, _setPluginRatio() copies them over, and setRatio() acts normally, applying css-specific values to the element.\n\t\t\t * This method returns an object that has the following properties:\n\t\t\t *  - proxy: a generic object containing the starting values for all the properties that will be tweened by the external plugin.  This is what we feed to the external _onInitTween() as the target\n\t\t\t *  - end: a generic object containing the ending values for all the properties that will be tweened by the external plugin. This is what we feed to the external plugin's _onInitTween() as the destination values\n\t\t\t *  - firstMPT: the first MiniPropTween in the linked list\n\t\t\t *  - pt: the first CSSPropTween in the linked list that was created when parsing.

These instances store important information like the target, property, starting value, amount of change, etc. They can also optionally have a number of \"extra\" strings and numeric values named xs1, xn1, xs2, xn2, xs3, xn3, etc. where \"s\" indicates string and \"n\" indicates number. These can be pieced together in a complex-value tween (type:1) that has alternating types of data like a string, number, string, number, etc. For example, boxShadow could be \"5px 5px 8px rgb(102, 102, 51)\". In that value, there are 6 numbers that may need to tween and then pieced back together into a string again with spaces, suffixes, etc. xs0 is special in that it stores the suffix for standard (type:0) tweens, -OR- the first string (prefix) in a complex-value (type:1) CSSPropTween -OR- it can be the non-tweening value in a type:-1 CSSPropTween. We do this to conserve memory.\n\t\t\t * CSSPropTweens have the following optional properties as well (not defined through the constructor):\n\t\t\t *  - l: Length in terms of the number of extra properties that the CSSPropTween has (default: 0). For example, for a boxShadow we may need to tween 5 numbers in which case l would be 5; Keep in mind that the start/end values for the first number that's tweened are always stored in the s and c properties to conserve memory. All additional values thereafter are stored in xn1, xn2, etc.\n\t\t\t *  - xfirst: The first instance of any sub-CSSPropTweens that are tweening properties of this instance. For example, we may split up a boxShadow tween so that there's a main CSSPropTween of type:1 that has various xs* and xn* values associated with the h-shadow, v-shadow, blur, color, etc. Then we spawn a CSSPropTween for each of those that has a higher priority and runs BEFORE the main CSSPropTween so that the values are all set by the time it needs to re-assemble them. The xfirst gives us an easy way to identify the first one in that chain which typically ends at the main one (because they're all prepende to the linked list)\n\t\t\t *  - plugin: The TweenPlugin instance that will handle the tweening of any complex values. For example, sometimes we don't want to use normal subtweens (like xfirst refers to) to tween the values - we might want ThrowPropsPlugin or BezierPlugin some other plugin to do the actual tweening, so we create a plugin instance and store a reference here. We need this reference so that if we get a request to round values or disable a tween, we can pass along that request.\n\t\t\t *  - data: Arbitrary data that needs to be stored with the CSSPropTween. Typically if we're going to have a plugin handle the tweening of a complex-value tween, we create a generic object that stores the END values that we're tweening to and the CSSPropTween's xs1, xs2, etc. have the starting values. We store that object as data. That way, we can simply pass that object to the plugin and use the CSSPropTween as the target.\n\t\t\t *  - setRatio: Only used for type:2 tweens that require custom functionality. In this case, we call the CSSPropTween's setRatio() method and pass the ratio each time the tween updates. This isn't quite as efficient as doing things directly in the CSSPlugin's setRatio() method, but it's very convenient and flexible.\n\t\t\t * @param {!Object} t Target object whose property will be tweened. Often a DOM element, but not always. It could be anything.\n\t\t\t * @param {string} p Property to tween (name). For example, to tween element.width, p would be \"width\".\n\t\t\t * @param {number} s Starting numeric value\n\t\t\t * @param {number} c Change in numeric value over the course of the entire tween. For example, if element.width starts at 5 and should end at 100, c would be 95.\n\t\t\t * @param {CSSPropTween=} next The next CSSPropTween in the linked list. If one is defined, we will define its _prev as the new instance, and the new instance's _next will be pointed at it.\n\t\t\t * @param {number=} type The type of CSSPropTween where -1 = a non-tweening value, 0 = a standard simple tween, 1 = a complex value (like one that has multiple numbers in a comma- or space-delimited string like border:\"1px solid red\"), and 2 = one that uses a custom setRatio function that does all of the work of applying the values on each update.\n\t\t\t * @param {string=} n Name of the property that should be used for overwriting purposes which is typically the same as p but not always. For example, we may need to create a subtween for the 2nd part of a \"clip:rect(...)\" tween in which case \"p\" might be xs1 but \"n\" is still \"clip\"\n\t\t\t * @param {boolean=} r If true, the value(s) should be rounded\n\t\t\t * @param {number=} pr Priority in the linked list order. Higher priority CSSPropTweens will be updated before lower priority ones. The default priority is 0.\n\t\t\t * @param {string=} b Beginning value. We store this to ensure that it is EXACTLY what it was when the tween began without any risk of interpretation issues.\n\t\t\t * @param {string=} e Ending value. We store this to ensure that it is EXACTLY what the user defined at the end of the tween without any risk of interpretation issues.\n\t\t\t */\n\t\t\tCSSPropTween = _internals.CSSPropTween = function(t, p, s, c, next, type, n, r, pr, b, e) {\n\t\t\t\tthis.t = t; //target\n\t\t\t\tthis.p = p; //property\n\t\t\t\tthis.s = s; //starting value\n\t\t\t\tthis.c = c; //change value\n\t\t\t\tthis.n = n || p; //name that this CSSPropTween should be associated to (usually the same as p, but not always - n is what overwriting looks at)\n\t\t\t\tif (!(t instanceof CSSPropTween)) {\n\t\t\t\t\t_overwriteProps.push(this.n);\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\tthis.r = r; //round (boolean)\n\t\t\t\tthis.type = type || 0; //0 = normal tween, -1 = non-tweening (in which case xs0 will be applied to the target's property, like tp.t[tp.p] = tp.xs0), 1 = complex-value SpecialProp, 2 = custom setRatio() that does all the work\n\t\t\t\tif (pr) {\n\t\t\t\t\tthis.pr = pr;\n\t\t\t\t\t_hasPriority = true;\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\tthis.b = (b === undefined) ? s : b;\n\t\t\t\tthis.e = (e === undefined) ? s + c : e;\n\t\t\t\tif (next) {\n\t\t\t\t\tthis._next = next;\n\t\t\t\t\tnext._prev = this;\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t},\n\n\t\t\t_addNonTweeningNumericPT = function(target, prop, start, end, next, overwriteProp) { //cleans up some code redundancies and helps minification.

For example:\n\t\t *\n\t\t * CSSPlugin.registerSpecialProp(\"myCustomProp\", function(target, value, tween) {\n\t\t *      var start = target.style.width;\n\t\t *      return function(ratio) {\n\t\t *              target.style.width = (start + value * ratio) + \"px\";\n\t\t *              console.log(\"set width to \" + target.style.width);\n\t\t *          }\n\t\t * }, 0);\n\t\t *\n\t\t * Then, when I do this tween, it will trigger my special property:\n\t\t *\n\t\t * TweenLite.to(element, 1, {css:{myCustomProp:100}});\n\t\t *\n\t\t * In the example, of course, we're just changing the width, but you can do anything you want.\n\t\t *\n\t\t * @param {!string} name Property name (or comma-delimited list of property names) that should be intercepted and handled by your function. For example, if I define \"myCustomProp\", then it would handle that portion of the following tween: TweenLite.to(element, 1, {css:{myCustomProp:100}})\n\t\t * @param {!function(Object, Object, Object, string):function(number)} onInitTween The function that will be called when a tween of this special property is performed. The function will receive 4 parameters: 1) Target object that should be tweened, 2) Value that was passed to the tween, 3) The tween instance itself (rarely used), and 4) The property name that's being tweened. Your function should return a function that should be called on every update of the tween. That function will receive a single parameter that is a \"change factor\" value (typically between 0 and 1) indicating the amount of change as a ratio. You can use this to determine how to set the values appropriately in your function.\n\t\t * @param {number=} priority Priority that helps the engine determine the order in which to set the properties (default: 0).

The reason this functionality is\n\t\t * wrapped into a separate static method of CSSPlugin instead of being integrated into all regular className tweens\n\t\t * is because it creates entirely new tweens that may have completely different targets than the original tween,\n\t\t * so if they were all lumped into the original tween instance, it would be inconsistent with the rest of the API\n\t\t * and it would create other problems. For example:\n\t\t *  - If I create a tween of elementA, that tween instance may suddenly change its target to include 50 other elements (unintuitive if I specifically defined the target I wanted)\n\t\t *  - We can't just create new independent tweens because otherwise, what happens if the original/parent tween is reversed or pause or dropped into a TimelineLite for tight control? You'd expect that tween's behavior to affect all the others.\n\t\t *  - Analyzing every style property of every child before and after the tween is an expensive operation when there are many children, so this behavior shouldn't be imposed on all className tweens by default, especially since it's probably rare that this extra functionality is needed.\n\t\t *\n\t\t * @param {Object} target object to be tweened\n\t\t * @param {number} Duration in seconds (or frames for frames-based tweens)\n\t\t * @param {Object} Object containing the end values, like {className:\"newClass\", ease:Linear.easeNone}\n\t\t * @return {Array} An array of TweenLite instances\n\t\t */\n\t\tCSSPlugin.cascadeTo = function(target, duration, vars) {\n\t\t\tvar tween = TweenLite.to(target, duration, vars),\n\t\t\t\tresults = [tween],\n\t\t\t\tb = [],\n\t\t\t\te = [],\n\t\t\t\ttargets = [],\n\t\t\t\t_reservedProps = TweenLite._internals.reservedProps,\n\t\t\t\ti, difs, p, from;\n\t\t\ttarget = tween._targets || tween.target;\n\t\t\t_getChildStyles(target, b, targets);\n\t\t\ttween.render(duration, true, true);\n\t\t\t_getChildStyles(target, e);\n\t\t\ttween.render(0, true, true);\n\t\t\ttween._enabled(true);\n\t\t\ti = targets.length;\n\t\t\twhile (--i > -1) {\n\t\t\t\tdifs = _cssDif(targets[i], b[i], e[i]);\n\t\t\t\tif (difs.firstMPT) {\n\t\t\t\t\tdifs = difs.difs;\n\t\t\t\t\tfor (p in vars) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\tif (_reservedProps[p]) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdifs[p] = vars[p];\n\t\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom = {};\n\t\t\t\t\tfor (p in difs) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom[p] = b[i][p];\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t\tresults.push(TweenLite.fromTo(targets[i], duration, from, difs));\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\treturn results;\n\t\t};\n\n\t\tTweenPlugin.activate([CSSPlugin]);\n\t\treturn CSSPlugin;\n\n\t}, true);\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n/*\n * ----------------------------------------------------------------\n * RoundPropsPlugin\n * ----------------------------------------------------------------\n */\n\t(function() {\n\n\t\tvar RoundPropsPlugin = _gsScope._gsDefine.plugin({\n\t\t\t\tpropName: \"roundProps\",\n\t\t\t\tversion: \"1.6.0\",\n\t\t\t\tpriority: -1,\n\t\t\t\tAPI: 2,\n\n\t\t\t\t//called when the tween renders for the first time.
